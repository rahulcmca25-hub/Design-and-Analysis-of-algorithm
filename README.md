# Design-and-Analysis-of-algorithm
This contain the practicals of Design and analysis of algorithm

List of Practicals 
1. Implement Insert Sort  and run it on a synthetic data of (Name : string type, age : float 
type) for n = 10, 20, …100. For each n, randomly generate at least 10 data sets. Report 
the average number of comparisons for each n. Plot a graph and obtain a best-fit 
curve. (6 hours) 
a. write a function to sort on age  
b. write a function to sort on names 
c. sort on age and then on names so that the ordering on age is maintained. i.e. 
For (Reeta, 18.3), (Reeta 17.8), (Geet, 18.3), the output should be  (Geet, 
18.3), (Reeta 17.8), (Reeta, 18.3). I.e. If there are two people with the name 
Reeta their records should appear so that they are sorted on their ages. 
2. Program based on real life Application of Sorting: for example weather data or sort 
the edges of a graph on its weights - used in connectivity planning. (2 hours) 
3. Repeat 1 and 2 with Merge Sort and Compare with the results of Insertion Sort. 
(4 hours) 
4. Repeat 1 and 2 with Quick Sort and Compare with the results of Insertion Sort and 
Merge Sort. (4 hours) 
5. Repeat 1 and 2 with Randomized Quick Sort and Compare with the results of Quick 
Sort.  (2 hours)
6. Implement radix Sort and run it on a synthetic data of (Name : string consisting of 10 
characters, age in years: integers in the range 10 to 20 ) for n = 10, 20, …100. For 
each n, randomly generate at least 10 data sets. Report the average number of 
comparisons for each n. Plot a graph and obtain a best-fit curve.  (4 hours) 
a. write a function to sort on age  
b. write a function to sort on names 
c. sort on age and then on names so that the ordering on age is maintained. 
d. Compare with the results of Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort and 
Randomized Quick Sort. 
7. Programs on Graphs, as required. (2 hours) 
8. Problem Solving based on Sorting, Searching, Graph problems, Greedy and Dynamic 
Programming. (6 hours)
